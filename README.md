The server was generated using [express-generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html) and the client was generated using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Using these projects as a base, Fork this repo, and write an Express API and React app to display a list of Animals. Some placeholder animal data is provided in /server/data.js 

```const data = require('./data');```
